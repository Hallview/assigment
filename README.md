Difference between VAR , LESS, CONS
var sparingly, as its function scope and hoisting behavior can lead to unexpected results.
while less is used when you need to reassign a variable within a block scope.
 and const for values that should not be reassigned (constants), but remember that it doesn't make objects or arrays immutable; you can't reassign the variable itself, but you can modify its properties or elements.
