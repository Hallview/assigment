Assignment ,understanding  the Differences between Git and Github 
What is git and what problem does it solve in the context of software development?
Git can be defined or better explained as  an open-source distributed version control system. In the context of software development, it solves the problem of tracking and managing changes to software code.

Explain the difference between Git and Github 

Git and GitHub are often used interchangeably, but there are key differences between the two.

Git is a distributed version control system used to manage changes to source code during software development. It is designed to help coordinate work among programmers, but it can also be used to manage changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflow.

Github, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a graphical user interface and social features like user profiles, wikis, and a web-based graphical interface for creating and managing Git repositories. It also offers collaboration features like pull requests, bug tracking, and integration with other services like Jenkins and Travis .

Describe the basic workflow for using Git for version control 
Initialize a Repository: Start by initializing a Git repository in your project directory using the git init command. This creates a new empty Git repository or re-initializes an existing one.

Stage Changes: Use the git add command to stage changes. Staging means preparing the changes you want to include in the next commit. You can selectively stage specific files or stage all changes using git add . command.

Commit Changes: Once changes are staged, use the git commit command to create a new commit with a descriptive commit message. A commit represents a snapshot of your code at a particular point in time. It is good practice to make atomic commits, which means including related changes together in a single commit.

Branching: If you want to work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch using the git branch command. You can switch to the new branch using git checkout or create a new branch and switch to it using git checkout -b command.

Merge Changes: When you have made changes in a separate branch and want to incorporate those changes into the main branch, use the git merge command. This combines the changes from the source branch into the destination branch.

Push Changes: If you are working with a remote repository like GitHub, you can push your local commits to the remote repository using git push command. This updates the remote repository with your local changes.

Pull Changes: If there are new changes in the remote repository, you can update your local copy by pulling the changes using git pull command.

Handle Conflicts: In case of conflicts while merging or pulling changes, Git provides tools to help resolve conflicts and choose the appropriate changes.

This is a high-level overview of the basic Git workflow. The exact steps and commands may vary depending on the specific use case and workflow being followed.

What is a Git repository ? 
n Git, a repository (also called "repo") is a collection of files, version control metadata, and configuration files managed by Git. It is like a folder that contains all the source code and related files for a project, along with the full history of changes made to those files.

How does it store and manage version of files ?

Git repository stores and manages versions of files by creating commits^1. A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time. When you make changes to a file in your repository and want to save those changes, you first stage the changes using the git add command, which tells Git to start tracking those changes. Once you have staged the changes, you can create a commit using the git commit command.

Every commit in Git is identified by a unique hash, which is based on the contents of the files and directories in that commit. Each commit has a pointer to the parent commit that came before it,

What is a Commit , A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time.

The Concept of Branching ;Branching in Git allows you to create separate lines of development within your repository.
 
How branching can be useful in collaboration Development . They are as followed- Parallel development , Code Review, Testing and Experimentation , Stable and Development branches and hotfixes and emergency change .
Overall, branching in collaborative development provides a structured and efficient workflow, enabling teams to work on different tasks simultaneously, review and validate code changes, test new features, and maintain stable releases
